This book (A collection of research papers) can teach you necessary quant skills, the exercises provided in the book is a great way to ensure you will have a solid understanding of implementating quantitative strategy. From "A" to "Z".

At the same time, you might want to know that this is one of the graduate textbooks used in Cornell University for their Msc programe.

The book itself teaches very rational methods to quantitative finance, most of the concepts (especially triple barriers/ bet sizing) can be cross-reference to other strategies types (not just mean-reversion) such as volatilities, trends.
